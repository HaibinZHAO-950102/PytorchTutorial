# PytorchTutorial
This document is for the joint work at SDIL (https://www.sdil.de/de) as tutor and the work at TECO - KIT - Helmholtz (www.teco.edu, www.kit.edu, www.helmholtz.de) as Ph.D. candidate who supervises under- and post-graduates in the field of Electronic Design Automation, Neuromorphic Computing, and Edge ML.

The Chinese version goes first.  
The English version may come later.   
The German version seems hopeless.   

Any comments and suggestions are welcome. （contact: haibin.zhao@kit.edu）
